# Funding Carry Dashboard

This Funding Carry Dashboard is a tool that collects real-time data from a cryptocurrency exchange, processes key metrics such as cumulative returns, and presents the insights in an interactive dashboard. Designed specifically for funding carry strategies, this app helps traders analyze performance, track funding rate differentials, and optimize their trading decisions.

## Includes:

The app follows a classical three-layer architecture that divides apps into three layers: the **Presentation Layer**, the **Logic Layer** and the **Data Access Layer**.

1. **The Presentation Layer: Data Analytics Dashboard**

- An interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as cumulative returns and funding carry opportunities.

2. **The Logic Layer: Data Handling**

- Processes raw exchange data, computes funding carry metrics, and applies business logic.

3. **The Data Access Layer: Database and Data Access**

- Manages data retrieval, storage, and interaction with the crypto exchange API.

## Installation

First, clone the repository.

 ```bash
 git clone 'https://github.com/MarkusMusch/DeltaNeutral.git' && cd DeltaNeutral/
 ```

Second, install all necessary dependencies by calling:

 ```bash
 poetry install
 ```

## Usage

For permanent usage, the application comes with a Docker file to build a Docker container.

To build the container run:

 ```bash
 sudo docker build -t deltaneutral .
 ```

 To start the container run:

 ```bash
 sudo docker run -d -p 8050:8050 --name deltaneutral-container --restart unless-stopped deltaneutral
 ```

 This starts the container on Port 8050. Once up and running you can access your dashboard by visiting http://0.0.0.0:8050/ in a browser.

 The --restart option when starting the container makes the container start every time you boot your computer. Since the app is downloading the newest data upon starting, it can take a few moments until the app is available in the browser after booting your system.
